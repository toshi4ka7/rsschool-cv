				<h3>#Summary</h3>
				<p>I love programming - because it's cool. Writing code that does something that feels great. I can write code for hours and not notice how time flies. Programming allows you to develop your brain and not degrade over time.</p>
				<p>I tried myself in Front-end and Bask-end development, and for me Bask-end development is more suitable. Because all the logic of the site or application is done there.</p>
				<p>Therefore, after this course, I want to focus on the northern part of programming using <b>Node.js</b></p>
