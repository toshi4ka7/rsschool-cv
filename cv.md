 ### Summary
 I love programming - because it's cool. Writing code that does something that feels great. I can write code for hours and not notice how time flies. Programming allows you to develop your brain and not degrade over time.
 
 I tried myself in Front-end and Bask-end development, and for me Bask-end development is more suitable. Because all the logic of the site or application is done there.
 
 Therefore, after this course, I want to focus on the northern part of programming using **Node.js**
 
 ### Skills
 **Programming languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL.
 
 **Frameworks:** Bootstrap, Less preprocessor, jQuery.
 
 **Version control:** Git, GitHub.

 ### Experience 
 My last job is website development [kera.by](http://kera.by/). 
 Front-end and Bask-end parts of the site I wrote from scratch without using frameworks.
 My goal was to find out how all this is created, how it all works.
 
 ### Education
 Self-education. I've read books, articles, free seminars, and practiced a lot of coding practice.
 
### English
  My English is between beginner and intermediate. Many things in English I understand.
